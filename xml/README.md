XML resources used for autogenerating classes and enumerations.

Note that the XML provided in this part of the project is NOT used for final DIS-XML expression or validation.
Rather, it is a set of simple data structures that are subsequently turned into a properly defined XML Schema.
This design and implementation was originally achieved by Don McGregor NPS.

Now available: experimental [XML Schema for DIS](DIS_7_2012.autogenerated.xsd) with [documentation](https://savage.nps.edu/open-dis7-java/xml/SchemaDocumentation/DIS_7_2012.autogenerated.html)
