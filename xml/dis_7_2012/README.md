This directory contains a series of PDU data definitions that express
data structures for all 72 DIS7 protocol data units.  These are assembled 
as a single [DIS7 definitions XML](DIS_7_2012.xml) that is parsed and 
processed to produce an experimental [DIS7 XML Schema](../DIS_7_2012.autogenerated.xsd).

We expect that a similar approach can be pursued to support developmental
efforts on DIS version 8 and the Compressed DIS (C-DIS) protocols.
