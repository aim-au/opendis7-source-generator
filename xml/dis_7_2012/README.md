This directory contains a series of PDU data definitions that express
data structures for all 72 DIS7 protocol data units.  These are parsed
and assembled to produce an experimental [DIS7 XML Schema](DIS_7_2012.xml).

We expect that a similar approach can be pursued to support developmental
efforts on DIS version 8 and the Compressed DIS (C-DIS) protocols.
