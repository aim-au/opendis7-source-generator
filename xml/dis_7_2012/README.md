This directory contains a series of PDU data definitions that define match
data structures for all 72 DIS version 7 protocol data units.  These are assembled 
as a single [DIS7 definitions XML](DIS_7_2012.xml) that is parsed and 
processed to produce an experimental [DIS7 XML Schema](../DIS_7_2012.autogenerated.xsd).

Note that the XML provided in this part of the project is NOT used for final DIS-XML expression or validation. 
Rather, it is a set of simple data structures that are subsequently turned into a properly defined XML Schema. 
This design and implementation was originally achieved by Don McGregor NPS.

We expect that a similar approach can be pursued to support developmental
efforts on DIS version 8 and the Compressed DIS (C-DIS) protocols.
