These classes are authored/copied manually and provide support for intermediate 
compilation of autogenerated code that is not compiling correctly.

In general these are used to override autogenerated classes that are somehow insufficient.
Long-term goal is to eliminate all of these classes by achieving proper autogeneration.

TODO remove!
